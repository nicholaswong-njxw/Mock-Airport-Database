# Mock-Airport-Database

Implemented a functional airport database interface allowing users to see, book, edit, and cancel flights. Interface contains a username/password system and client dashboard. Backend development is coded in SQL using MySQL. Attaching it to a usable interface was done using PHP, XAMPP and Apache.  
(Note: this was done as a group project with classmates whose names are removed for confidentiality purposes)
