# Mock-Airport-Database

Implemented a functional airport database interface allowing users to see, book, edit, and cancel flights. Interface contains a username/password system and client dashboard. Backend development is coded in SQL using MySQL. Attaching it to a usable interface was done using PHP, XAMPP and Apache.  
(Note: this was done as a group project with classmates whose names are removed for confidentiality purposes)

Files included:  
Mock Airport Database Report.pdf - report detailing the process of developing this database from theoretical enhanced entity relation diagrams to demonstration of final product  
create.sql - building of the relational schema inside MySQL, establishes the information structure for our airport database  
load.sql - loaded in sample information to test functionality of website  
(Note: the .php is not currently provided as it was made on a peer's device. Look to the report to see demonstration of the working database and interface)
